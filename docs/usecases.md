# torproxy

## Motivations
This project has born from the will to maintain a kubernetes project.
I started looking for challenging and original ideas to not re-implement things that already existed.
Further, my interest for networking, privacy and freedom of speech played a fundamental role in choosing what to build.

## Use cases

This tool could be used for very malicious scopes, please, don't.

Here there is a list of legit use cases for which this controller could be used for:

1. **Secure and Private Web Hosting**: Hosting platform that require anonymity, such as whistleblower platforms, sensitive human rights sites where the primary concern is the privacy of the server and users from adversaries, useful for journalists, activists and bloggers in censoring regimes where revealing server's location could be a threat to people's life.
2. **Honeypots**: Deploying honeypots to attract and monitor malicious activity without revealing their true locations, protecting the integrity of security research.
3. **Anonymous marketplace**: Operating decentralized marketplaces where both buyers and sellers need to remain anonymous to protect their privacy
4. **Anonymized IoT Communications**: Ensuring IoT devices communicate securely and anonymously, protecting the identity and location of the devices.
5. **Secure Edge Computing**: Deploying edge nodes that process sensitive data anonymously, crucial in environments where data security is more important than processing speed.
6. **Advocacy Support Tools**: Tools that support privacy advocates and activists, ensuring their communications and activities are protected from surveillance.
